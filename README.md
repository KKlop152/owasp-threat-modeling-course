# OWASP-Threat-Modeling-Course
Repo for hosting documentation, material, notes, and exercises from OWASP DC 2025 Threat Modeling Intensive with AI. The course is taught by **Adam Shostack** and is 3 days long in Washington DC from Nov 3-5 2025.

Course material consists of pre-requisites to be completed prior to the start date of the course and material to be completed during the course. 

**Course Intent**:  You'll learn to Threat Model, and then you'll revist and learn to complement those skills with a variety of AI systems. You need to know how to threat model to evaluate what the AIs hallucinate, and today you need AI (at least to get your AI loving boss to leave you alone) and maybe even to help your organization scale.
